            <b>Ronald Bilius Weasley</b> is a fictional character in J. K.
            Rowling's Harry Potter fantasy novel series. His first appearance
            was in the first book of the series,
            <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, as the best friend
            of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley
            family, a pure blood family that resides in "The Burrow" outside
            Ottery St. Catchpole. Being the only member of the three main
            characters raised in magical society, he also provides insight into
            the Wizarding World's magical customs and traditions. Along with
            Harry and Hermione, he is a member of
            <strong>Gryffindor house</strong> and is present for most of the
            action throughout the series.

    <h2 id="B1">Character development</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      According to Rowling, Ron was among the characters she created "the very
      first day."<sup>[1]</sup> Ron is inspired by Rowling's best friend Sean
      Harris (to whom <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em> is
      dedicated), but she has clearly stated that she "never set out to describe
      Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase."<sup>[2]</sup> Like
      Harris is to Rowling, Ron is "always there" when Harry needs him. Ron fits
      many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; he is often used as
      comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry
      possesses, at least, early on, in terms of magical power. However, he
      proves his bravery and magical ability several times, such as by playing
      'real wizard's chess' in the first book, entering into the Forbidden
      Forest with Harry during the second book despite his arachnophobia,
      producing a full-corpreal Patronus Charm in the fifth book and even, in
      the seventh book, getting basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets by
      mimicking Parseltongue without understanding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of Ron's qualities serve as foils to Harry's. Whereas Harry is an
      orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron comes from a loving but poor
      family. Many of his possessions are hand-me-downs. Harry is famous but
      would prefer to avoid the spotlight; Ron, in comparison, is often
      perceived as a mere lackey and sometimes becomes jealous of the
      recognition Harry receives. Overshadowed by his many siblings and the fame
      and achievements of his friends, Ron's inferiority complex and need to
      prove himself are the main thrusts of his character arc. As the books
      progress, he matures from a inscecure boy to a competent young man capable
      of strategy and leadership.

                <p class="p1">Rowling first introduces Ron with his family in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Harry is lost at King's Cross railway station, and the Weasleys guide him through the barrier at Platform 9Â¾ into the wizarding world. Ron and Harry share a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, and they begin their friendship. Ron is fascinated with the famous Harry, and Harry is fascinated with the ordinary Ron. On the train, they both meet Hermione Granger as well, whom they initially dislike but who later becomes their close friend after they save each other during a dangerous encounter with a mountain troll. Ron and Harry share the same classes throughout the series and generally have similar academic successes and disappointments. Ron plays a vital part in the quest to save the Philosopher's Stone. His strategy at Wizard's Chess allows Hermione and Harry to proceed safely through a dangerous, life-sized animated chess game. During the game, Ron allows his piece to be sacrificed and is subsequently knocked unconscious. At the Leaving Feast, the last dinner of the school year, Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts's Headmaster, awards Ron fifty House points to Gryffindor for "the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years." These last-minute points help support Gryffindor's securing of the House Cup.</p>

    Rupert Grint portrays Ron Weasley in all eight Harry Potter films. He audtioned after seeing a segment on the BBC childrens' news programme, Newsround, inviting children to send in information abou themselves. Grint sent in a photo, a self-written script and a rap, documenting his desire to portray the character.<sup><a href="#R3">[16]</a></sup>
    <br>
    Rowling was supportive of the casting, calling Grint "perfect" for the role of Ron.<sup><a href="#R4">[17]</a></sup> Grint's potrayal of the character was critically acclaimed with him receiving a Satellite Award in the category of "Outstanding New Talent",<sup><a href="#R5">[18]</a></sup> and a Young Artist Award for "Most Promising Young Newcomer" for his performance in the first film. His potrayal has often been cited as the best of three main characters.<sup><a href="#R6">[19]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <h3 id="B4_2">Theatre portrayals</h3>
  <p>
    In 2016, British actor Paul Thornley played Ron Weasley in the Original London Cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at the Palace Theatre, London in the West End. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Play at the 2017 Whatsonstage.com Awards. Thornley reprised his role as Ron Weasley on Broadway at the Lyric Theater in 2018.
